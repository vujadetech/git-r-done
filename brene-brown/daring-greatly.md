### Notes related to Brene Brown's _Daring Greatly_

- The 3 components of scarcity: __shame/comparison/disengagement__.

- The opposite of “never enough” isn’t abundance or “more
than you could ever imagine.” The opposite of scarcity is enough, or what I call _Wholeheartedness_.

#### Vulnerability Myths
- __MYTH #1: “VULNERABILITY IS WEAKNESS.”__

	- To believe vulnerability is weakness is to believe that feeling is weakness.
	
	- Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.

	- __I define vulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional
exposure.__

	- _Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage._
	
	- __Vulnerability feelings__
		- You are halfway across a tightrope, and moving forward and going back are both just as scary.
		
		- Going out on a limb—a very, very high limb.
		
		- Being all in.
		
		- Freedom and liberation.
		
		- Letting go of control. (Personal note - "Being comfortable with being uncomfortable," as [J Chachula](http://www.theflyingmachine.net/instructors.html) might put it.)
		
	- And the answer that appeared over and over in all of our efforts to better understand vulnerability? Naked.
		- Vulnerability is like being naked onstage and hoping for applause rather than laughter.
		
		- It’s being naked when everyone else is fully clothed.
		
		- It feels like the naked dream: You’re in the airport and you’re stark naked.
			
	- Merriam-Webster defines _weakness_ as the inability to withstand attack or wounding.
	
		- Weakness often stems from a lack of vulnerability.

	- Far from being an effective shield, the illusion of invulnerability undermines the very response that would have supplied genuine protection.

	- _Give me the courage to show up and let myself be seen._
	
	- What’s worth doing even if I \[know I will\] fail?
	
	> Love is not a victory march, it’s a cold and it’s a
broken hallelujah. - _Leonard Cohen_

	- From calling a friend who’s experienced a terrible tragedy to starting your own business, from feeling terrified to experiencing liberation, vulnerability is life’s great dare.

- __MYTH #2: “I DON’T DO VULNERABILITY”__

> To be alive is to be vulnerable. — _Madeleine L’Engle_

- __MYTH #3: VULNERABILITY IS LETTING IT ALL HANG OUT__

	- We need to feel trust to be vulnerable and we need to be vulnerable in order to trust. (Personal note - trust and vulnerability are mutually recursive.)
	
	- Trust is built one marble at a time. (Personal note - cf with Covey's emotional bank account/the physics of relationships).
	
	- Trust is a product of vulnerability that grows over time and requires work, attention, and full engagement. Trust isn’t a grand gesture—it’s a growing marble collection.

- __MYTH #4: WE CAN GO IT ALONE__

	- When we attach judgment to receiving help, we knowingly or unknowingly attach judgment to giving help (from Gifts of Imperfection).
	
	-  We simply can’t learn to be more vulnerable and courageous on our own. Sometimes our first and greatest dare is asking for support.

#### Chapter 3, UNDERSTANDING AND COMBATING SHAME (AKA, GREMLIN NINJA WARRIOR TRAINING)

- Shame resilience is key to embracing our vulnerability. We can’t let ourselves be seen if we’re terrified by what people might think. Often ‘not being good at vulnerability’ means that we’re damn good at shame.

> Only when we’re brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light.
	
- In order to be vulnerable, we need to develop resilience to shame.
	
-  If they love it [your product/art/etc], you’re worthy; if they don’t, you’re worthless.

- Expect to have to try and try again to get it right — be more willing to get innovative and creative in your efforts.

-  _Daring greatly_ requires worthiness. Shame sends the gremlins.
