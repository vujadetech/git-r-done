### Notes related to Brene Brown's _Daring Greatly_

- The 3 components of scarcity: __shame/comparison/disengagement__.

- The opposite of “never enough” isn’t abundance or “more
than you could ever imagine.” The opposite of scarcity is enough, or what I call _Wholeheartedness_ (p26).

#### Myths
- MYTH #1: “VULNERABILITY IS WEAKNESS.”

	- To believe vulnerability is weakness is to believe that feeling is weakness.
	
	- Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.

	- __I define vulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional
exposure.__

	- _Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage._
	
	- __Vulnerability feelings__
		- You are halfway across a tightrope, and moving forward and going back are both just as scary.
		
		- Going out on a limb—a very, very high limb.
		
		- Being all in.
		
		- Freedom and liberation.
		
		- Letting go of control. (personal note - "Comfortable with being uncomfortable," as [J Chachula](http://www.theflyingmachine.net/instructors.html) might put it.)
