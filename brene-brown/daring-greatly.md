- The 3 components of scarcity: __shame/comparison/disengagement__.

- The opposite of “never enough” isn’t abundance or “more
than you could ever imagine.” The opposite of scarcity is enough, or what I call _Wholeheartedness_.

#### Myths
- MYTH #1: “VULNERABILITY IS WEAKNESS.”

	- To believe vulnerability is weakness is to believe that feeling is weakness.
	
	- Vulnerability is the birthplace of love, belonging, joy, courage, empathy, and creativity. It is the source of hope, empathy, accountability, and authenticity. If we want greater clarity in our purpose or deeper and more meaningful spiritual lives, vulnerability is the path.

	- __I define vulnerability as uncertainty, risk, and emotional
exposure.__

	- _Vulnerability sounds like truth and feels like courage._
	
	- __Vulnerability feelings__
		- You are halfway across a tightrope, and moving forward and going back are both just as scary.
		
		- Going out on a limb—a very, very high limb.
		
		- Being all in.
		
		- Freedom and liberation.
		
		- Letting go of control. (Personal note - "Comfortable with being uncomfortable," as [J Chachula](http://www.theflyingmachine.net/instructors.html) might put it.)
		
	- And the answer that appeared over and over in all of our efforts to better understand vulnerability? Naked.
		- Vulnerability is like being naked onstage and hoping for applause rather than laughter.
		
		- It’s being naked when everyone else is fully clothed.
		
		- It feels like the naked dream: You’re in the airport and you’re stark naked.
			
	- Merriam-Webster defines _weakness_ as the inability to withstand attack or wounding.
	
		- Weakness often stems from a lack of vulnerability.

	- Far from being an effective shield, the illusion of invulnerability undermines the very response that would have supplied genuine protection.

	- _Give me the courage to show up and let myself be seen._
	
	- What’s worth doing even if I \[know I will\] fail?
	
	> Love is not a victory march, it’s a cold and it’s a
broken hallelujah. - _Leanord Cohen_

	- From calling a friend who’s experienced a terrible tragedy to starting your own business, from feeling terrified to experiencing liberation, vulnerability is life’s great dare.
