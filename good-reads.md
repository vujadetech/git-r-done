My book/blog ideas

- Me go pee pee where? Foreign language learning for adults who don't want to look stupid; get over it, you're the only one who's worried about it

- God doesn't like you
- Release yourself from the tyranny of free will by embracing determinism: in fact if determinism is true you can't willfully embrace anything, but let's gloss over that technical issue for now

- You don't know [Dyck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyck_language) - but keep reading and you will!

- Group theory/abstract algebra for complete freakin' morons: seriously, the motivating examples are from gradeschool arithmetic, so if you can't understand it I have to wonder how you managed to make it to the end of this sentence.

- Learn category theory with David Hasselhoff (see examples in the solutions to CMAFITC.md and category-theory-notes.md)
